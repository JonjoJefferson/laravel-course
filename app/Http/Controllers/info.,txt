Laravel 8 - IMPORTANT UPDATE
Laravel 8 Update



On the lecture called called "Routing Controllers" I show you how to route your requests using a controller. Laravel recently updated this feature and the code changed.

You are going to see me, using a code similar to this below

Route::get('/', 'HomeController@index')
Every time you see that code, you need to change it to something similar to the ones below



  Route::get('/checking', '\App\Http\Controllers\HomeController@index'); 



As you can probably tell, now we have to include the whole path of that controller in the method.



OR


You can also use the one below, which I like best.



use App\Http\Controllers\HomeController; //
 
 
Route::get('/', [EdwinsController::class, 'index']);
